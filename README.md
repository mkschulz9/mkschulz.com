# Matthew Schulz's Personal Website

- Welcome to the behind the scenes of Matthew Schulz's personal website! This
  website is a React application built from scratch that showcases some of
  Matthew's projects and more. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be
  accessed at [mkschulz9.github.io](https://mkschulz9.github.io).

## Technologies Used

- [Blank]

## Features

- [Blank]

### Bugs:

- images in about me are taking too long to load on deployed site
- figure out why linting is not working (ESLint) -> thinks files are ignored
  when I do not set any ignore patterns
  - I think it is because I am using a different version of ESLint than the one
    that is installed in the project. I will try to install the same version of
    ESLint that I am using globally in the project.
- smallest view when components are side by side -> dropdowns get too small

### AI/ML Feature Ideas:

- speechify website in my voice (i.e., explain my projects, resume, etc.)

### ToDo:

- make theme consistent (font; some settings in index.html)
- make sidebar collapsible
- add analytics to website
- Add tests in CI in the future using Cypress (if tests are needed)
